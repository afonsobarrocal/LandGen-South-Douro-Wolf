## Code Repository - Staying Close to Home: Connectivity constraints in an isolated wolf subpopulation (`LandGen-South-Douro-Wolf`)



Repository structure:

+ `output`:
  + `maxent`:
    + `results`: here are the output PDF files from MaxEnt and also an Excel file with the variables of the selected MaxEnt models sorted by their contribution to the models' gain
    + `suitability_surfaces`: here are the (average) suitability surfaces of each MaxEnt model tested
+ `scripts`:
  + here are the scripts used for (part of) the processing of the variables used in MaxEnt and for performing the MRDMs
  + `data`:
    + Since the Iberian wolf (*Canis lupus signatus*) is an endangered species in Portugal, some of the input information used in the scripts is not available here
    + `tif`: here are the raster layers used in the scripts
